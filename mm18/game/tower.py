# This is the tower class
# Towers get created here.
# I'm thinking have this as a superclass and make the specialised classes from this?
# Or not - it may just be easier to put it all in here because towers don't need a lot
# All towers need:
#   -A position
#   -Attack Power
#   -Tower 'level'
#   -Tower upgrade/build cost
#   -Tower sellback price (are we implementing this?)
